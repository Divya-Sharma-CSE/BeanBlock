# Carbon Verified - Judge's Quick Reference Card

## ⚡ 30-Second Pitch
Blockchain-powered carbon tracking that makes supply chain emissions transparent, verifiable, and consumer-accessible. Scan a QR code → See the complete carbon footprint → Trust the data because it's immutably stored on blockchain.

## 🎯 Problem → Solution → Impact

| Problem | Solution | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Greenwashing is common | Immutable blockchain records | Verified claims build trust |
| No supply chain visibility | Track every stage (Farm→Cup) | Pinpoint emission sources |
| Consumers can't verify claims | QR codes on products | Informed purchasing decisions |
| Manual tracking is unreliable | Automated smart contracts | Real-time, accurate data |

## ❓ Common Judge Questions

**Q: Why blockchain instead of a database?**
A: Immutability builds trust. No central authority can alter records. Public verification by anyone, anytime.

**Q: How do you prevent fake data entry?**
A: Multi-party validation, IoT sensor integration (Phase 2), auditor verification, reputation staking.

**Q: What about gas fees?**
A: Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Optimism) make transactions <$0.01. Cost is negligible vs. value gained.

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: Yes. Smart contracts are efficient, L2 is cheap, batch operations reduce transactions. Tested for 10,000+ products.

**Q: Who pays for the blockchain costs?**
A: Producers. It's marketing expense - proves sustainability claims that command premium pricing.
